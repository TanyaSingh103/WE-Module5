            <p>
                My childhood was quite carefree and encouraging. 
                I grew up in a nuclear family with my parents and younger sister.
                Early exposure to different forms of art in my daily life made me develop similar interests.

                <p>
                    I completed my complete school education from the primary to 12th grade in the same school.
                    I performed decently at academics throught school life, showing great improvement in my senior secondary education after I improved my learning methods. 
                    I had been involved in academic competetions like Olympiads since a young age and acheived a worldwide under 100 rank in the English Olympiad in 8th grade.
                    My best grades were during 12th grade whereas my social life at school peaked in 10th grade, put to a sudden halt thanks to covid.

                    College.. well taught me a lot, most of the times outside of the classrooms. I got into the WE program towards the end of my first year. 
                    Like every other 3rd year student, I'm also searching for an internship for next summer.
